We have done a comparitive study between two implementation-types of recommender systems: RippleNet and an Autoencoder.

RippleNet:
RippleNet is a knowledge-graph based implementation to recommendation systems, in which the user's particular interests are branched out in a hierarchical manner, and the user's click rate is used to formulate preferences. Preference propagation is used in that way, so that at the end, the algorithm can calculate the probability that a user will click on a particular movie. 



Autoencoder:
An Autoencoder is a type of neural network, in which the main flow of the system goes as follows: The input data, the encoding, is learned for a particular set of data. In our case, it is MovieLens dataset. Then in our implementation, there are 6 hidden layers in between. The purpose of having hidden layers is to provide a set of weighted inputs and produce an output through some type of an activation function.
